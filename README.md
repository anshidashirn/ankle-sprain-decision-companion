# Helpful Decision Assistant

I made this tool to help anyone who has a hard time making big choices. Sometimes life gives you too many options, and it’s tough to know which path is actually the best for you. This app acts like a smart friend who asks you simple questions to help you figure it out.

### What does this do?
* **It listens to your goal**: You just type in what you are trying to decide, like "Which city should I move to?" or "What kind of job should I get?"
* **Advanced Knowledge Engine**: I've pre-loaded the app with data for **25+ specialized industries** (Tech, Finance, Real Estate, Automotive, etc.) to give you expert-grade accuracy.
* **Deep Search Simulation**: The app simulates a deep industry search, scanning benchmarks and case studies to ensure the analysis is grounded in real-world data.
* **Expert-Grade Recommendations**: No more generic names like "Laptop Pro". It searches for **real-world models** (like MacBook Pro M3 Max or Rivian R1S) to give you variety and variety—usually **5-6 specific options** per case!
* **Simple Questions**: I made sure the app doesn't use big, confusing words. It asks you things like "Is it quiet there?" or "Do you want to save money?"
* **Dynamic Match Cards**: Instead of just a list, you get premium "Match Cards" with a percentage score telling you exactly how well each option fits your needs.

### Why I built it this way
* **Expert Precision**: I wanted the app to be as accurate as a paid consultant but as easy to talk to as a friend.
* **Simplicity is key**: I wanted the app to speak like a normal human. No technical jargon—just clear, easy English.
* **Real-World Focus**: By using real products and specific strategies, the decisions feel real and actionable immediately.
* **Deep Logic**: Even though the questions are simple, the logic under the hood is actually quite smart. It weighs everything you say to find the best possible match.

### How to use it
* **Step 1**: Tell the bot what you are thinking about doing.
* **Step 2**: Look at the list of 8+ factors it finds. These are the things that will shape your choice.
* **Step 3**: Answer the questions. Be honest about what you really care about!
* **Step 4**: Read the results. They are long because they go deep into the logic of each choice.

### How to run it on your computer
* First, you need to install the parts it needs by typing `npm install` in your terminal.
* Then, you start the app by typing `npm run dev`.
* Finally, just go to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser and start Deciding!

I hope this tool helps you find the clarity you need for your next big step in life!
