# Helpful Decision Assistant

I made this tool to help anyone who has a hard time making big choices. Sometimes life gives you too many options, and it’s tough to know which path is actually the best for you. This app acts like a smart friend who asks you simple questions to help you figure it out.

### What does this do?
* **It listens to your goal**: You just type in what you are trying to decide, like "Which city should I move to?" or "What kind of job should I get?"
* **It finds the important stuff**: The app automatically figures out at least 8 things (we call them factors) that usually matter for that choice.
* **It asks you simple questions**: I made sure the app doesn't use big, confusing words. It asks you things like "Is it quiet there?" or "Do you want to save money?"
* **It explains the results in detail**: Instead of just giving you a score, the app tells you a long and detailed story about why a certain choice is good for your specific situation.

### Why I built it this way
* **Simplicity is key**: I wanted the app to speak like a normal human. No technical jargon or "academic" talk—just clear, easy English.
* **Deep logic**: Even though the questions are simple, the logic under the hood is actually quite smart. It weighs everything you say to find the best possible match.
* **Persuasive results**: The goal isn't just to show data, but to actually help you feel confident in your decision by explaining it clearly.

### How to use it
* **Step 1**: Tell the bot what you are thinking about doing.
* **Step 2**: Look at the list of 8+ factors it finds. These are the things that will shape your choice.
* **Step 3**: Answer the questions. Be honest about what you really care about!
* **Step 4**: Read the results. They are long because they go deep into the logic of each choice.

### How to run it on your computer
* First, you need to install the parts it needs by typing `npm install` in your terminal.
* Then, you start the app by typing `npm run dev`.
* Finally, just go to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser and start Deciding!

I hope this tool helps you find the clarity you need for your next big step in life!
