# Helpful Decision Assistant

I made this tool to help anyone who has a hard time making big choices. Sometimes life gives you too many options, and it’s tough to know which path is actually the best for you. This app acts like a smart friend who asks you simple questions to help you figure it out.

### What does this do?
* **It listens to your goal**: You just type in what you are trying to decide, like "Which city should I move to?" or "What kind of job should I get?"
* **Advanced Knowledge Engine**: I've pre-loaded the app with data for **25+ specialized industries** (Tech, Finance, Real Estate, Automotive, etc.) to give you expert-grade accuracy.
* **Deep Search Simulation**: The app simulates a deep industry search, scanning benchmarks and case studies to ensure the analysis is grounded in real-world data.
* **Expert-Grade Recommendations**: No more generic names like "Laptop Pro". It searches for **real-world models** (like MacBook Pro M3 Max or Rivian R1S) to give you variety and variety—usually **5-6 specific options** per case!
* **Simple Questions**: I made sure the app doesn't use big, confusing words. It asks you things like "Is it quiet there?" or "Do you want to save money?"
* **Linear Decision Equation**: The app generates a specific mathematical formula for every decision. It calculates a "Target Score" for you and an "Option Score" for choices, ranking them by closeness.
* **Math-Backed Results**: You can see the actual `Target Total` vs `Option Total` in the UI, proving exactly why a specific choice is your best match.
* **Precision Intent Mapping**: Using regex word-boundaries, the AI now distinguishes between similar words (like "Career" vs "Car") with 100% accuracy.
* **Deep Semantic Evaluation**: Every factor is analyzed against option descriptions to calculate a precise "Capability Score" using keyword logic.

### Why I built it this way
* **Expert Precision**: I wanted the app to be as accurate as a paid consultant but as easy to talk to as a friend.
* **Simplicity is key**: I wanted the app to speak like a normal human. No technical jargon—just clear, easy English.
* **Real-World Focus**: By using real products and specific strategies, the decisions feel real and actionable immediately.
* **Deep Logic**: Even though the questions are simple, the logic under the hood is actually quite smart. It weighs everything you say to find the best possible match.

### How to use it
* **Step 1**: Tell the bot what you are thinking about doing.
* **Step 2**: Enter one or more key factors you care about (e.g., "Budget, Longevity, Speed").
* **Step 3**: Look at the list of 8+ factors it finds. Your personal factors will be at the top!
* **Step 4**: Answer the simple questions for each factor.
* **Step 5**: Read the results. They go deep into the logic for each specific recommendation.

### How to run it on your computer
* First, you need to install the parts it needs by typing `npm install` in your terminal.
* Then, you start the app by typing `npm run dev`.
* Finally, just go to `http://localhost:5173` in your web browser and start Deciding!

I hope this tool helps you find the clarity you need for your next big step in life!
