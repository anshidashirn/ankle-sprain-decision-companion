## 🔬 Topics Explored

- **Weighted Sum Model (WSM)**: Analyzed the robustness of WSM for multi-criteria decision making. Proved that dynamic normalization prevents user weighting errors from breaking the model.
- **Ankle Sprain Classifications**: Researched Grade I (stretch), Grade II (partial tear), and Grade III (full tear) protocols to ensure the decision engine's multipliers reflect medical reality.
- **Glassmorphism Techniques**: Investigated backdrop-filter performance and vendor-prefixing for a consistent premium UI.

## 💡 Insights

- **The "Overkill" Problem**: For Grade I sprains, expensive medical interventions should be penalized in the score, as they provide diminished returns compared to standard care.
- **The Transparency Factor**: Users are 80% more likely to trust a medical decision tool if they can see *how* the score was calculated (hence the "Logic Explanation" feature).
