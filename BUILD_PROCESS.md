# Build Process

## Initial Interpretation
I interpreted the problem as designing a general multi-criteria decision engine.

## Topic Selection Rationale
I chose ankle sprain rehabilitation because it involves clear trade-offs between recovery speed, cost, and risk.

## Early Design Decision
I decided to use a weighted scoring model instead of AI-based ranking to ensure explainability.
